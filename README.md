💱 Java Currency Converter App

Welcome to my Currency Converter App — a simple yet powerful tool built in Java to convert between currencies! Whether you're learning Java or just want a handy console-based converter, this project is a great example of real-world Java programming.
🌍 Features

    ✅ Converts between major currencies (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, INR, etc.)

    🔄 Realistic conversion using predefined exchange rates (can be modified easily)

    🧠 Beginner-friendly code structure and comments

    ⚠️ Input validation to prevent errors

    🛠️ Ready for extensions (e.g., GUI or live exchange rates)

🛠️ Tech Stack

    Language: Java

    IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code

    I/O: Console-based (using Scanner)

    Style: Clean OOP structure with methods and clear logic

🧪 Sample Run

Welcome to Currency Converter!

Enter amount: 100  
From currency (e.g., USD): USD  
To currency (e.g., EUR): EUR  

Converted Amount: 100.0 USD = 92.5 EUR

🧠 How It Works

This app uses a set of hardcoded exchange rates to simulate real-world conversions. The user inputs an amount and selects the source and target currencies. The app performs the calculation and displays the converted result. It also handles common errors like unknown currency codes or invalid numbers.
